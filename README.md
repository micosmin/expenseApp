Behavior to test:

1. API saves the expense we record

Objective:
Test the API behavior

- I can nest modules inside a describe block: nesting Rack::Test::Methods
- Using this particular module for the 'post' helper method
  - This simulated an HTTP POST request
  - It calls the app directly, and does not generate or parse HTTP Packets
